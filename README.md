### README Recipe Finder 


## Overview of our project 


When we were brainstorming as a team, we were trying to solve a common problem someone might have. As we were doing so we came up with a couple different ideas, like a video game website and care of plants website. We finally decided to create a recipe finder that would allow the user to find different recipes and help finding the perfect dinner dishes to serve to the user's family. In working as a team we established a workflow, where we would meet up on google team meetings. We also split our work into different branches with our names to keep organized, so that we can push into our develop branch. Our develop branch is where we can test code and merge all of our branches into. Once we have the develop branch working the way we want, then we can push it into our main branch, where it is deployed to git pages.
