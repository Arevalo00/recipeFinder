# README Recipe Finder

## Description

When we were brainstorming as a team, we were trying to solve a common problem someone might have. As we were doing so we came up with a couple different ideas, those being a video game website that used Steam's API, a cooking website, and a gardening website. We finally decided to go with the cooking website which we would call recipe finder, the website would allow the user to find different recipes to make the perfect dinner dishes to serve to the user's family. In working as a team we established a workflow where we would meet up on google team meetings in addition to the time we had together in class. We created our own branch with our name to keep organized, so that we can push into our respective branch and then create a pull request from our branch into the develop branch. Our develop branch is where we can test code and merge all of our branches into. Once we have the develop branch working the way we want it to then we can create a pull request from develop into main.
